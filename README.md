# RBAC Analytics Dashboard

A full-stack **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) analytics dashboard** built with **FastAPI** and **Streamlit**.

This system demonstrates **secure authentication, role-based authorization, KPI analytics dashboards, and audit logging**. Different user roles have different access levels to data and administrative tools.

---

# Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world analytics platform where users log in and access dashboards depending on their **role and department**.

The backend provides secure REST APIs, while the frontend visualizes analytics through a simple interactive dashboard.

---

# Key Features

### Secure Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing using Passlib
- Secure login endpoints

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Three roles are implemented:

| Role | Permissions |
|-----|-----|
| Admin | Full access to dashboard, users, and audit logs |
| Manager | Access analytics for their department |
| Viewer | Read-only dashboard access |

### Analytics Dashboard
- KPI summary metrics
- Interactive charts
- Filterable data tables
- Department-level access control

### Admin Tools
- View all users
- Modify user roles
- Manage departments

### Audit Logging

Important actions are logged for monitoring:

- User login
- Role updates
- Data exports
- Administrative actions

---

# Tech Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI**
- **SQLAlchemy**
- **Pydantic**
- **JWT Authentication**
- **SQLite Database**

### Frontend
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas**
- **Requests**

### Other Tools
- Python Virtual Environment
- Git & GitHub
